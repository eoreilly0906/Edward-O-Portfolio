## How It's Made:
Using React, Javescript, HTML and CSS inplementation in React.
Using Netlify to deploy and VS Code to build
Tailwind is used to style the pages

**Tech used:**  JavaScript, React Love and affection


## Lessons Learned:
I found it tricky to implement the CSS. As well as figuring out the path of files in order to deploy
on Netlify.
React is definatly a language that I find difficult, yet rewarding in the end.
I still feel like I don't fully have a grasp on it but will keep trying!
